      " The average hourly rate in San Francisco is 146US$ per hour, excl. tax, but you can also book venues for as cheap as 2US$ per hour.\n",
      " How many hours are included in the daily rate?\n",
      " The daily rate represents a 10 hour use of the space on business hours: from 8am to 6pm or from 9am to 7pm for example. Please keep in mind that the opening hours can vary from space to space and that additional fees may occur outside of the opening hours. Please note that some spaces may have an 8 hour daily rate only - in that case, the information is given in the space description.\n",
      " What is the difference between a booking and a reservation?\n",
      " There are two possible ways to book a space on Spacebase:\n",
      "- Direct booking: if you request to book a room, the space owner has 72 hours to confirm or decline the request. When it is confirmed, the space will be booked for your event.\n",
      "- Reservation: you request a 3 days non-binding reservation. The space owner has 72 hours to confirm or decline your request. In case it is confirmed, you have 72 hours to make your final decision to either book the space or decline the reservation. You turn the reservation into a booking by choosing a payment method on the hire details page.\n",
      " Can I book the location for just a couple of hours?\n",
      " Sure, most of the spaces are bookable per hour. In that case, you can find the price per hour on the venue detail page. Some spaces charge a minimum booking fee, which you can find on the space profile as well.\n",

      " The average hourly rate in San Francisco is 146US$ per hour, excl. tax, but you can also book venues for as cheap as 2US$ per hour.\n",
      " How many hours are included in the daily rate?\n",
      " The daily rate represents a 10 hour use of the space on business hours: from 8am to 6pm or from 9am to 7pm for example. Please keep in mind that the opening hours can vary from space to space and that additional fees may occur outside of the opening hours. Please note that some spaces may have an 8 hour daily rate only - in that case, the information is given in the space description.\n",
      " What is the difference between a booking and a reservation?\n",
      " There are two possible ways to book a space on Spacebase:\n",
      "- Direct booking: if you request to book a room, the space owner has 72 hours to confirm or decline the request. When it is confirmed, the space will be booked for your event.\n",
      "- Reservation: you request a 3 days non-binding reservation. The space owner has 72 hours to confirm or decline your request. In case it is confirmed, you have 72 hours to make your final decision to either book the space or decline the reservation. You turn the reservation into a booking by choosing a payment method on the hire details page.\n",
      " Can I book the location for just a couple of hours?\n",
      " Sure, most of the spaces are bookable per hour. In that case, you can find the price per hour on the venue detail page. Some spaces charge a minimum booking fee, which you can find on the space profile as well.\n",

      " The average hourly rate in San Francisco is 146US$ per hour, excl. tax, but you can also book venues for as cheap as 2US$ per hour.\n",
      " How many hours are included in the daily rate?\n",
      " The daily rate represents a 10 hour use of the space on business hours: from 8am to 6pm or from 9am to 7pm for example. Please keep in mind that the opening hours can vary from space to space and that additional fees may occur outside of the opening hours. Please note that some spaces may have an 8 hour daily rate only - in that case, the information is given in the space description.\n",
      " What is the difference between a booking and a reservation?\n",
      " There are two possible ways to book a space on Spacebase:\n",
      "- Direct booking: if you request to book a room, the space owner has 72 hours to confirm or decline the request. When it is confirmed, the space will be booked for your event.\n",
      "- Reservation: you request a 3 days non-binding reservation. The space owner has 72 hours to confirm or decline your request. In case it is confirmed, you have 72 hours to make your final decision to either book the space or decline the reservation. You turn the reservation into a booking by choosing a payment method on the hire details page.\n",
      " Can I book the location for just a couple of hours?\n",
      " Sure, most of the spaces are bookable per hour. In that case, you can find the price per hour on the venue detail page. Some spaces charge a minimum booking fee, which you can find on the space profile as well.\n",
