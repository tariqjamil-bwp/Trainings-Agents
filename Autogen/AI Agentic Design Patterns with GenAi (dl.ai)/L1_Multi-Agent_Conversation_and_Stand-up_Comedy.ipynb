      "(laughs) Ah, that's a great one, my friend! Yeah, I mean, \"artisanal\" is just code for \"we charged you more for it.\" Like, \"artisanal cardboard box\"? No, it's just a box! (laughs) But you know what's even funnier? When they put \"small batch\" on something. Oh, so it's made in small batches, huh? Yeah, I'm pretty sure that just means the guy making it got tired after a few hours and said, \"Yeah, that's it for today!\" (laughs)\n",

      "(laughs) Oh, Joe, you're killing me! Small batch, yeah, that's just code for \"our production team is really lazy\"! (laughs) I mean, can you imagine if they started putting that on people's business cards? \"John Smith, Small Batch Accountant: Only crunching numbers for 3 hours a day, then I need a nap!\" (laughs)\n",
      "\n",
      "And you know what's even better? When they put \"all-natural\" on food labels. Like, what's the opposite of that? \"All-unnatural\" ingredients? \"Warning: contains 100% artificial everything, including the hopes and dreams of our marketing team\"! (laughs)\n",

      "You know, I was at the grocery store the other day, and I saw a label that said \"100% organic, free-range, gluten-free, vegan, non-GMO, cruelty-free...\" And I'm thinking, \"What's left? Are you telling me this food is made of unicorn tears and fairy dust?\" (laughs) I mean, can't they just simplify it and say, \"It's just a bunch of stuff we found in the forest\"? (laughs)\n",

I mean, I've had kale chips that were literally just forest floor scraps, like they just swept up the forest floor and put it in a bag! (laughs) \"All-natural\" is just code for \"we didn't bother washing it, so you get to find the dirt and twigs yourself\"! (laughs)\n",
      "\n",
      "You know, have you ever noticed that the more labels they add, the less appealing the food becomes? Like, \"gluten-free, vegan, soy-free, nut-free, taste-free\"... (laughs) I mean, what's left? Air? (laughs)\n",

      "\n",
      "And you're right, the more labels they add, the less appealing it becomes. I mean, have you seen those labels that are like, \"Warning: may contain traces of actual food\"?
