It chronicles the adventures of the title character and his aquatic friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. The series received worldwide critical acclaim, and had gained popularity by its second season. As of 2019, the series is the fifth-longest-running American animated series. Its popularity made it a multimedia franchise, the highest rated Nickelodeon series, and the most profitable intellectual property for Paramount Consumer Products. By 2019, it had generated over $13 billion in merchandising revenue.[4] Many of the series' ideas originated in The Intertidal Zone, an unpublished educational comic book Hillenburg created in 1989 to teach his students about undersea life.[5] Hillenburg joined Nickelodeon in 1992 as an artist on Rocko's Modern Life.[6] After Rocko was cancelled in 1996, he began developing SpongeBob SquarePants into a television series that same year, and in 1997, a seven-minute pilot was pitched to Nickelodeon. The network's executives wanted SpongeBob to be a child in school, but Hillenburg preferred SpongeBob to be an adult character.[7] He was prepared to abandon the series, but compromised by creating Mrs. Puff and her boating school so SpongeBob could attend school as an adult.[8] The series has run for a total of fourteen seasons, and has inspired three feature films: The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (2004), Sponge Out of Water (2015), and Sponge on the Run (2020). Two spin-off series, Kamp Koral: SpongeBob's Under Years and The Patrick Star Show, premiered in 2021. As of February 2022, four additional films are planned: three character spinoff films for Paramount+ and Netflix, and a theatrical SpongeBob film. The fourteenth season of the main series was announced in March 2022,[9] and premiered in November 2023. In September 2023, the show was renewed for a fifteenth season.[10] SpongeBob SquarePants has won a variety of awards including six Annie Awards, eight Golden Reel Awards, four Emmy Awards, two BAFTA Children's Awards, and a record-breaking twenty-one Kids' Choice Awards. A Broadway musical based on the series opened in 2017 to critical acclaim.[11] The series is also noted as a cultural touchstone of Millennials and Generation Z.[12][13] Premise Characters Main article: List of SpongeBob SquarePants characters The series' main characters. Top row, from left to right: Pearl, Plankton, and Karen. Bottom row: Sandy, Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob, Squidward, Gary, Patrick, and Mrs. Puff. The series revolves around the title character and an ensemble cast of his aquatic friends. SpongeBob SquarePants is an energetic and optimistic yellow sea sponge who lives in a submerged pineapple. SpongeBob has a childlike enthusiasm for life, which carries over to his job as a fry cook at a fast food restaurant called the Krusty Krab. One of his life's greatest goals is to obtain a boat-driving license from Mrs. Puff's Boating School, but he never succeeds. His favorite pastimes include \\\"jellyfishing\\\", which involves catching jellyfish with a net in a manner similar to butterfly catching, and blowing soap bubbles into elaborate shapes. He has a pet sea snail with a pink shell and a blue body named Gary, who meows like a cat. Living two houses away from SpongeBob is his best friend Patrick Star, a dimwitted yet friendly pink starfish who resides under a rock. Despite his mental setbacks, Patrick sees himself as intelligent.[14] Squidward, SpongeBob's next-door neighbor and co-worker at the Krusty Krab, is an arrogant, ill-tempered octopus who lives in an Easter Island moai. He enjoys playing the clarinet and painting self-portraits but hates his job as a cashier. He dislikes living between SpongeBob and Patrick because of their childish nature. The owner of the Krusty Krab is a miserly, greedy red crab named Mr. Krabs who talks like a sailor and runs his restaurant as if it were a pirate ship. He is a single parent with a teenage daughter, a grey sperm whale named Pearl, to whom he wants to bequeath his riches. Pearl does not want to continue the family business and would rather spend her time listening to music or working at the local shopping mall.[15] Another of SpongeBob's friends is Sandy Cheeks, a thrill-seeking and athletic squirrel from Texas, who wears an air-filled diving suit to breathe underwater.[16] She lives in a tree enclosed in a clear glass dome locked by an airtight, hand-turned seal and is an expert in karate. Located across the street from the Krusty Krab is an unsuccessful rival restaurant called the Chum Bucket.[17] It is run by a small, green, one-eyed copepod[18] named Plankton and his computer wife, Karen.[19] Plankton constantly tries to steal the secret recipe for Mr. Krabs's popular Krabby Patty burgers, hoping to gain the upper hand and put the Krusty Krab out of business.[20] Karen supplies him with evil schemes to obtain the formula, but their efforts always fail and their restaurant rarely has any customers.[21] When SpongeBob is not working at the Krusty Krab, he is often taking boating lessons from Mrs. Puff, a paranoid but patient pufferfish. SpongeBob is Mrs. Puff's most diligent student and knows every answer to the oral exams he takes, but he panics and crashes when he tries to drive a real boat.[22] When Mrs. Puff endures one of SpongeBob's crashes or is otherwise frightened, she puffs up into a ball.[23] An unseen figure called the French Narrator often introduces episodes and narrates the intertitles as if the series were a nature documentary about the ocean. His role and distinctive manner of speaking are references to the oceanographer Jacques Cousteau.[24] Recurring guest characters appear throughout the series including: the retired superheroes Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, who are idolized by SpongeBob and Patrick; a pirate specter known as the Flying Dutchman; the muscular lifeguard of Goo Lagoon, Larry the Lobster; and the merman god of the sea, King Neptune. There is also a large variety of characters who are known as the incidentals who serve as the main background characters for the show and are featured in almost every episode. They are each referred as \\\"Incidental\\\" followed by their given model number. Their names, jobs, personalities, relationships, voices, ages, and sometimes gender are inconsistent and tend to differ from each episode. There are 222 of these characters.[citation needed] Special (generally half-hour or hour-long) episodes of the show are hosted by a live-action pirate named Patchy and his pet parrot Potty, whose segments are presented in a dual narrative with the animated stories.[25] Patchy is portrayed as the president of a fictional SpongeBob fan club, and his greatest aspiration is to meet SpongeBob himself. Potty likes to make fun of Patchy's enthusiasm and causes trouble for him while he tries to host the show. Setting \\\"Bikini Bottom\\\" redirects here. For other uses, see Bikini Bottom (disambiguation). Bikini Atoll, a coral reef in the Pacific Ocean. Tom Kenny confirmed the fictitious city of Bikini Bottom is named after Bikini Atoll. The series takes place primarily in the benthic underwater city of Bikini Bottom located in the Pacific Ocean beneath the real-life coral reef known as Bikini Atoll.[26][27][28][c] Its citizens are mostly multicolored fish who live in buildings made from ship funnels and use \\\"boatmobiles\\\", amalgamations of cars and boats, as a mode of transportation. Recurring locations within Bikini Bottom include the neighboring houses of SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward; two competing restaurants, the Krusty Krab and the Chum Bucket; Mrs. Puff's Boating School, which includes a driving course and a sunken lighthouse; the Treedome, an oxygenated glass enclosure where Sandy lives; Shady Shoals Rest Home; a seagrass meadow called Jellyfish Fields; and Goo Lagoon, a subaqueous brine pool that is a popular beach hangout.[30] When the SpongeBob crew began production of the series' pilot episode, they were tasked with designing stock locations, to be used repeatedly, where most scenes would take place like the Krusty Krab and SpongeBob's pineapple house.[31] The idea was \\\"to keep everything nautical\\\", so the crew used plenty of rope, wooden planks, ships' wheels, netting, anchors, boilerplates, and rivets to create the show's setting. Transitions between scenes are marked by bubbles filling the screen, accompanied by the sound of rushing water.[31] The series features \\\"sky flowers\\\" as a main setting material.[31] When series background designer Kenny Pittenger was asked what they were, he answered, \\\"They function as clouds in a way, but since the show takes place underwater, they aren't really clouds. Because of the Tiki influence on the show, the background painters use a lot of pattern.\\\"[31] Pittenger said the sky flowers were meant to \\\"evoke the look of a flower-print Hawaiian shirt\\\".[31] Production Development Early inspirations Before creating SpongeBob SquarePants, Stephen Hillenburg taught marine biology to visitors of the Ocean Institute (located in Dana Point, California).[32] Series creator Stephen Hillenburg first became fascinated with the ocean as a child and began developing his artistic abilities at a young age. Although these interests would not overlap for some time\\u2014the idea of drawing fish seemed boring to him\\u2014Hillenburg pursued both during college, majoring in marine biology and minoring in art. After graduating in 1984, he joined the Ocean Institute, an organization in Dana Point, California, dedicated to educating the public about marine science and maritime history.[32][33] While Hillenburg was there, his love of the ocean began to influence his artistry. He created a precursor to SpongeBob SquarePants: a comic book titled The Intertidal Zone used by the institute to teach visiting students about the animal life of tide pools.[33] The comic starred various anthropomorphic sea lifeforms, many of which would evolve into SpongeBob SquarePants characters.[34] Hillenburg tried to get the comic professionally published, but none of the companies he sent it to were interested.[33] A large inspiration to Hillenburg was Ween's 1997 album The Mollusk, which had a nautical and underwater theme. Hillenburg contacted the band shortly after the album's release, explaining the baseline ideas for SpongeBob SquarePants, and also requested a song from the band, which they sent on Christmas Eve. This song was \\\"Loop de Loop\\\", which was used in the episode \\\"Your Shoe's Untied\\\".[35][36][37] Conception While working as a staff artist at the Ocean Institute, Hillenburg entertained plans to return eventually to college for a master's degree in art. Before this could materialize, he attended an animation festival, which inspired him to make a slight change in course. Instead of continuing his education with a traditional art program, Hillenburg chose to study experimental animation at the California Institute of the Arts.[33] His thesis film, Wormholes, is about the theory of relativity.[38] It was screened at festivals, and at one of these, Hillenburg met Joe Murray, creator of the popular Nickelodeon animated series, Rocko's Modern Life. Murray was impressed by the style of the film and offered Hillenburg a job.[38][39] Hillenburg joined the series as a director, and later, during the fourth season, he took on the roles of producer and creative director.[34][38][39][40] Martin Olson, one of the writers for Rocko's Modern Life, read The Intertidal Zone and encouraged Hillenburg to create a television series with a similar concept. At that point, Hillenburg had not even considered creating his own series. However, he realized that if he ever did, this would be the best approach.[33][38][41] He began to develop some of the characters from The Intertidal Zone, including the comic's \\\"announcer\\\", Bob the Sponge.[33] He wanted his series to stand out from most popular cartoons of the time, which he felt were exemplified by buddy comedies like The Ren & Stimpy Show. As a result, Hillenburg decided to focus on a single main character: the \\\"weirdest\\\" sea creature he could think of. This led him to the sponge.[33] The Intertidal Zone's Bob the Sponge resembles an actual sea sponge, and at first, Hillenburg continued to use this design.[33][38][39][42] In determining the new character's behavior, Hillenburg drew inspiration from innocent, childlike figures that he enjoyed, such as Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, Jerry Lewis, and Pee-wee Herman.[33][39][43][44][45] He then considered modeling the character after a kitchen sponge and realized this idea would match the character's square personality perfectly.[33][38][39] Patrick, Mr. Krabs, Pearl, and Squidward were the next characters Hillenburg created for the show.[46] To voice the series' central character, Hillenburg turned to Tom Kenny, whose career in animation had started alongside Hillenburg's on Rocko's Modern Life. Elements of Kenny's own personality were employed to develop the character further.[47] Initially, Hillenburg wanted to use the name SpongeBoy\\u2014the character had no last name\\u2014and the series was to have been named SpongeBoy Ahoy![42][47] However, the Nickelodeon legal department discovered\\u2014after voice acting had been completed for the original seven-minute pilot episode\\u2014that the name \\\"SpongeBoy\\\" was already copyrighted.[48][47] In choosing a replacement name, Hillenburg felt he still had to use the word \\\"Sponge\\\", so that viewers would not mistake the character for a \\\"Cheese Man\\\". He settled on the name \\\"SpongeBob\\\". \\\"SquarePants\\\" was chosen as a family name after Kenny saw a picture of the character and remarked, \\\"Boy, look at this sponge in square pants, thinking he can get a job in a fast food place.\\\"[43] When he heard Kenny say it, Hillenburg loved the phrase and felt it would reinfor\", \"Stephen Hillenburg - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Creator of SpongeBob SquarePants (1961\\u20132018) Stephen HillenburgHillenburg in 2011, presenting the original series bible for SpongeBob SquarePantsBornStephen McDannell Hillenburg(1961-08-21)August 21, 1961Lawton, Oklahoma, U.S.DiedNovember 26, 2018(2018-11-26) (aged 57)San Marino, California, U.S.Alma mater Humboldt State University (BS) California Institute of the Arts (MFA) OccupationsAnimatorwriterproducerdirectorvoice actormarine biologistYears active1984\\u20132018Notable workSpongeBob SquarePants (1999\\u20132018)Rocko's Modern Life (1993\\u20131996)Spouse Karen Umland \\u200b(m. 1998)\\u200bChildren1Scientific careerFieldsMarine biologyInstitutionsOrange County Marine Institute Signature Stephen McDannell Hillenburg (August 21, 1961 \\u2013 November 26, 2018) was an American animator, writer, producer, director, voice actor, marine science educator, and entrepreneur. He was best known for creating the animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants for Nickelodeon in 1999. Serving as the showrunner for its first three seasons, and again from season nine until his death, the show has become the fifth-longest-running American animated series. He also provided the original voice of Patchy's pet, Potty the Parrot. Born in Lawton, Oklahoma and raised in Anaheim, California, Hillenburg became fascinated with the ocean as a child and developed an interest in art. He started his professional career in 1984, instructing marine biology at the Orange County Marine Institute, where he wrote and illustrated The Intertidal Zone, an informative picture book about tide-pool animals, which he used to educate his students. After two years of teaching, he enrolled at California Institute of the Arts in 1989 to pursue a career in animation. He was later offered a job on the Nickelodeon animated television series Rocko's Modern Life (1993\\u20131996) following the success of his 1992 short films The Green Beret and Wormholes, which were made as part of his studies. In 1994, Hillenburg began developing The Intertidal Zone characters and concepts for what became SpongeBob SquarePants, which has aired continuously since 1999. He also directed The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (2004), which he originally intended to be the series finale. He then resigned as showrunner, but remained credited as executive producer on subsequent seasons (even after his death). He later resumed creating short films with Hollywood Blvd., USA (2013). He co-wrote the story for the second film adaptation of the series, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water (2015), and received a posthumous executive producer credit for the third film, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run (2020). Besides his two Emmy Awards and six Annie Awards for SpongeBob SquarePants, Hillenburg also received other recognitions, such as an accolade from Heal the Bay for his efforts in elevating marine life awareness and the Television Animation Award from the National Cartoonists Society. Hillenburg announced he was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 2017, but stated he would continue working on SpongeBob for as long as possible. He died from the disease on November 26, 2018, at the age of 57. Early life and education[edit] Stephen McDannell Hillenburg[1] was born on August 21, 1961 at Fort Sill,[2][3][4][5] a United States Army post in Lawton, Oklahoma, where his father, Kelly N. Hillenburg Jr. (1936\\u20132006),[6] worked for the U.S. military and was a Methodist.[7][8] His mother, Nancy (n\\u00e9e Dufour),[6] taught visually impaired students and came from a Methodist family.[2][3][4][9] When he was a year old,[7] the family moved to Orange County, California,[2][4] where his father began a career as a draftsman and designer in the aerospace industry.[7] His younger brother, Bryan,[6] eventually became a draftsman/designer as well.[4] When an interviewer asked Hillenburg to describe himself as a child, he replied that he was \\\"probably well-meaning and naive like all kids.\\\"[10][11] His passion for sea life can be traced to his childhood, when films by Jacques Cousteau, a French oceanographer, made a strong impression on him.[4][7][12] Hillenburg said that Cousteau \\\"provided a view into that world\\\", which he had not known existed.[7] He liked to explore tide pools as a child, bringing home objects that \\\"should have been left there and that ended up dying and smelling really bad.\\\"[11] Hillenburg also developed his interest in art at a young age.[7][13] His first drawing was of an orange slice. An illustration which he drew in third grade, depicting \\\"a bunch of army men ... kissing and hugging instead of fighting\\\", brought him the first praise for his artwork, when his teacher commended it.[7] \\\"Of course, this is 1970 ... She liked it because, I mean, obviously that was in the middle of [the Vietnam War]. She was, I would imagine, not a hundred percent for the war like a lot of people then. ... I had no idea about the implications, really, because I just thought it was a funny idea. I remember that still, that moment when she said, 'oh my gosh, look at that'\\\", Hillenburg elaborated.[7] It was then when he knew he \\\"had some [creative] skill\\\".[7] He asserted that his artistry came from his mother's side, despite his father being a draftsman, noting that his maternal grandmother was \\\"really, really gifted\\\" and a \\\"great painter\\\".[7] In the 1970s, someone took Hillenburg to the International Tourn\\u00e9e of Animation at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. He was \\\"knocked out\\\" by the foreign animated films, including Dutch animator Paul Driessen's The Killing of an Egg (1977). \\\"That was the film that I thought was uniquely strange and that lodged itself in my head early on,\\\" he recounted.[14] \\\"I've always been interested in art and making things, but I chose not to go to art school because I thought I needed to do something else. Art was a tough way to make a living. I've always done both. I just kind of figured that the marine biology would be a career and the art would be something I did for my own self-expression.\\\" \\u2014 Stephen Hillenburg[10] He attended Savanna High School in Anaheim,[4][10][15] describing himself as a \\\"band geek\\\" who played the trumpet.[7] At age 15, he snorkeled for the first time;[3][4][10] Hillenburg took part in a \\\"dive program\\\"[7] at Woods Coves[10] in Laguna Beach,[3][4] as part of the Regional Occupational Program at Savanna.[7] This experience, as well as subsequent dives,[7] reinforced his interest in, and led to his decision to study, marine biology in college:[3][4][7][10][15] \\\"The switch clicked and I decided I wanted to be a marine biologist, but I also liked being an artist.\\\"[13] Some of his high-school teachers, who knew of his interest in art and fascination with the ocean, advised him otherwise,[7] saying: \\\"You should just draw fish.\\\"[7][16] However, the idea of drawing fish seemed boring to him and he was more riveted by \\\"making weird, little paintings\\\".[7] During a few summers after finishing high school, he worked as a fry cook and lobster boiler[17] at a fast-food seafood restaurant[4] in Maine.[17] (This later inspired SpongeBob SquarePants' occupation in the television series.[17]) Hillenburg went to Humboldt State University in Arcata, California, as a marine-science major.[7] He minored in art,[7] and said that \\\"[he] blossomed as a painter in Humboldt.\\\"[18] In 1984, he earned his bachelor's degree in natural-resource planning and interpretation, with an emphasis on marine resources.[3][4][15][19] He intended to take a master's degree, but said it would be in art:[7] \\\"Initially I think I assumed that if I went to school for art I would never have any way of making a living, so I thought it might be smarter to keep art my passion and hobby and study something else. But by the time I got to the end of my undergrad work, I realized I should be in art.\\\"[4] Early career[edit] Hillenburg taught marine ocean biology to visitors of the Orange County Marine Institute (pictured) in Dana Point, California, during the mid-1980s. After graduating from college, Hillenburg held various jobs in 1984, including as a park service attendant in Utah and an art director in San Francisco, before landing the job he wanted: teaching children.[7] He hoped to work in a national park on the coast,[13] and eventually found a job at the Orange County Marine Institute (now the Ocean Institute),[13] an organization in Dana Point, California, dedicated to educating the public about marine science and maritime history.[20] Hillenburg was a marine biology teacher there for three years:[3][4][21] \\\"We taught tide-pool ecology, nautical history, diversity and adaptation. Working there, I saw how enamored kids are with undersea life, especially with tide-pool creatures.\\\"[10][22] He stayed at the Dana Point Marina[15] and was also a staff artist.[7][17][23] Although \\\"[i]t was a great experience\\\" for him,[13] he realized he was more interested in art than his chosen profession.[21] While working there, one of the educational directors asked him if he would be interested in creating an educational comic book about the animal life of tidal pools.[7][13][24] He created a comic called The Intertidal Zone, which he used to teach his students.[24] It featured anthropomorphic forms of sea life, many of which would evolve into SpongeBob SquarePants characters[25] \\u2013 including \\\"Bob the Sponge\\\", the comic's co-host, who resembled a realistic sea sponge, as opposed to his later SpongeBob SquarePants character, a sea sponge whose stylized square shape resembles a kitchen sponge.[26] He tried to get the comic published, but the publishers he approached turned him down.[7][13] During this time, Hillenburg also started attending animation festivals such as the International Tourn\\u00e9e of Animation and Spike and Mike's Festival of Animation, where student films from the California Institute of the Arts (colloquially called CalArts) were shown.[7][14] He determined that he wanted to pursue a career in that field.[7][14] He had planned to take a master's degree in art, but instead of \\\"going back to school for painting\\\",[7] he left his job in 1987 to become an animator.[25][26] Hillenburg enrolled in CalArts' Experimental Animation Program[4][25][26] in 1989.[13] About this decision, he said: \\\"Changing careers like that is scary, but the irony is that animation is a pretty healthy career right now and science education is more of a struggle.\\\"[27] He studied under Jules Engel,[28][29] the founding director of the program,[29][30] whom he considered his \\\"Art Dad\\\" and mentor.[29][31][32] Impressed by The Intertidal Zone, Engel accepted him into the program.[7][26] Hillenburg said, \\\"[Engel] also was a painter, so I think he saw my paintings and could easily say, 'Oh, this guy could fit in to this program.' I don't have any [prior experience in] animation really.\\\"[7] Hillenburg graduated in 1992,[4][10] earning a Master of Fine Arts in experimental animation.[4] During his time at CalArts, he briefly drew comics for the surfing magazine KEMA in 1990.[33] Animation career[edit] Early works[edit] Shots from The Green Beret (top) and Wormholes (bottom) Hillenburg made his first animated works, short films The Green Beret (1991) and Wormholes (1992),[34] while at CalArts.[3][4][5][27] The Green Beret was about a physically challenged Girl Scout with enormous fists who toppled houses and destroyed neighborhoods while trying to sell Girl Scout cookies.[3][4][5] Wormholes was his seven-minute thesis film,[26][35] about the theory of relativity.[3][4][35] He described the latter as \\\"a poetic animated film based on relativistic phenomena\\\" in his grant proposal in 1991 to the Princess Grace Foundation,[36] which assists emerging artists in American theater, dance, and film.[37] The foundation agreed to fund the effort, providing Hillenburg with a Graduate Film Scholarship.[36][38] \\\"It meant a lot,\\\" he said in 2003. \\\"They funded one of the projects I'm most proud of, even with SpongeBob. It provided me the opportunity just to make a film that was personal, and what I would call independent, and free of some of the commercial needs.\\\"[36] Wormholes was shown at several international animation festivals,[27][36] including the Annecy International Animated Film Festival, the Hiroshima International Animation Festival, the Los Angeles International Animation Celebration, the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen,[39] and the Ottawa International Animation Festival,[40] where it won Best Concept.[41] LA Weekly called the film \\\"road-trippy\\\" and \\\"Zap-comical\\\",[42] while Manohla Dargis of The New York Times called it \\\"inventive\\\".[30] Hillenburg explained that \\\"anything goes\\\" in experimental animation. Although this allowed him to explore alternatives to conventional methods of filmmaking, he still ventured to employ \\\"an industry style\\\"; he preferred to traditionally animate his films (where each frame is drawn by hand) rather than, for instance, make cartoons \\\"by filming piles of sand changing\\\".[7] He made at least one other short film as an animation student, but its title is unspecified.[14][23] Rocko's Modern Life[edit] Hillenburg's first professional job in the animation business was as a director[23][26] on Rocko's Modern Life (1993\\u20131996),[3][23][25] Nickelodeon's first in-house cartoon production.[43] He \\\"ended up finding work in the industry and got a job\\\" at the television network after he met the show's creator, Joe Murray,[36] at the 1992 Ottawa International Animation Festival,[14][23] where Wormholes and Murray's My Dog Zero were both in competition.[40] Murray, who was looking for people to direct Rocko's Modern Life at the time,[23] saw Hillenburg's film and offered him a directorial role on the television series.[7][23][26] He \\\"[had] friends that [gave him] a hard time about [the offer]. ... but doors opened when [he] stepped into the animation world,\\\" so he accepted it.[23] He \\\"was planning on being a starving artist\\\": \\\"[I spent] several thousand dollars to make a film and [realized] I may not make it back\\u2014I had loans out. Fortunately, Joe Murray saw my film ... and he took a huge chance,\\\" Hillenburg related.[14] Hillenburg worked closely with Murray[44] on Rocko's Modern Life for its whole run on the air.[4] Aside from directing, he also produced, wrote and storyboarded for some episodes, and served as the executive story editor.[3][4] In particular, the third season episode \\\"Fish-N-Chumps\\\" was co-written and directed by Hillenburg, and involved Rocko, Heffer, and Filburt going on a fishing trip, oblivious to the fact that a pair of anthropomorphic sea creatures are attempting to catch them from underwater; this would foreshadow his later work with SpongeBob.[26] In 1995,[4][44] during the fourth and final season of Rocko,[45] Hillenburg was promoted to creative director, where he helped oversee pre- and post-production.[3][4][44] Working on the series enabled him to repay his loans.[13] He later related that he \\\"learned a great deal about writing and producing animation for TV\\\" from his stint on Rocko's Modern Life.[46] SpongeBob SquarePants[edit] Main article: SpongeBob SquarePants Creation[edit] Some evidence shows that the idea for SpongeBob SquarePants dates back to 1986, during Hillenburg's time at the Orange County Marine Institute.[47] He indicated that children's television series such as The New Adventures of Mighty Mouse (1987\\u20131988) and Pee-wee's Playhouse (1986\\u20131991) \\\"sparked something in [him].\\\" He continued, \\\"I don't know if this is true for everybody else, but it always seems like, for me, I'll start thinking about something and it takes about ten years to actually have it happen, or have someone else believe in it... It took me a few years to get [SpongeBob SquarePants] together.\\\"[23] During the production of Rocko's Modern Life, Martin Olson, one of the writers, read The Intertidal Zone and encouraged Hillenburg to create a te\", \"The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 2015 film by Paul Tibbitt The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of WaterTheatrical release posterDirected by Paul Tibbitt Mike Mitchell Screenplay by Jonathan AibelGlenn Berger Story by Stephen HillenburgPaul Tibbitt Based onSpongeBob SquarePantsby Stephen HillenburgProduced by Paul Tibbitt Mary Parent StarringAntonio BanderasTom KennyClancy BrownRodger BumpassBill FagerbakkeCarolyn LawrenceMr. LawrenceMatt Berry CinematographyPhil M\\u00e9heuxEdited byDavid Ian SalterMusic byJohn DebneyProductioncompanies Paramount Animation Nickelodeon Movies United Plankton Pictures Distributed byParamount PicturesRelease dates January 28, 2015 (2015-01-28) (Belgium)[1][2] February 6, 2015 (2015-02-06) (United States) Running time92 minutes[3]CountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglishBudget$60\\u201374 million[4][5]Box office$325.2 million[4] The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water is a 2015 American adventure comedy film based on the animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants. Directed by series veteran Paul Tibbit, the film stars Antonio Banderas as the live-action character Burger Beard and features the show's regular voice cast consisting of Tom Kenny, Clancy Brown, Rodger Bumpass, Bill Fagerbakke, Carolyn Lawrence, and Mr. Lawrence, with Matt Berry as a new character. The plot follows a pirate named Burger Beard, who steals the secret Krabby Patty formula using a magical book that makes any text written upon it come true. SpongeBob and his friends must travel to the ocean's surface to confront Burger Beard and retrieve the formula. It is the second theatrical film based on the series following the first in 2004. The film was written by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger; they adapted it from a story conceived by Tibbit and SpongeBob creator Stephen Hillenburg. Like the first film, the final act places the animated characters in a live-action world. However, unlike the first film, the animated characters become animated in CGI in the live-action world. These scenes were directed by Mike Mitchell and were filmed in Savannah and Tybee Island, Georgia. Filming began on September 30, 2013, and was completed in November that year. The film is dedicated to Ernest Borgnine, the voice of Mermaid Man, who died in 2012. Similarly, it features the final film role of Tim Conway, the voice of Barnacle Boy, before his death in 2019. The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water was released in the United States on February 6, 2015, in 3D and RealD 3D and received mostly positive reviews from critics. It was a box office success, earning over $325 million worldwide against its $60\\u201374 million budget, making it the third-highest-grossing Nickelodeon film and the 6th highest-grossing animated film of 2015. A third film, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run, was released in 2020. Plot[edit] A pirate named Burger Beard travels to Bikini Atoll, where he obtains a magical book that has the power to make any text written upon it real. The book tells the story of SpongeBob SquarePants and his adventures in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob works for Mr. Krabs at the Krusty Krab fast food restaurant, where he cooks Krabby Patties. SpongeBob has spent several years protecting the secret formula of the Krabby Patty from Plankton, the owner of the rival Chum Bucket. One day, Plankton attacks the Krusty Krab in an attempt to steal the formula. After a battle involving giant foods and condiments, Plankton feigns surrender and uses a decoy of himself to gain access to Krabs' vault. Plankton steals the formula, leaving a fake document in its place. SpongeBob catches Plankton and they fight over the formula, which abruptly disappears. Without the secret formula, Krabby Patties cannot be made and the customers become ravenous. Although Mr. Krabs believes Plankton is responsible, SpongeBob knows Plankton is innocent; the two escape Krabs by flying away in a soap bubble. Bikini Bottom is subsequently reduced to a wasteland due to the absence of the Krabby Patties. After a struggle between Burger Beard and some seagulls, a page of the book is discarded in the ocean and lands on Sandy Cheeks' tree dome. SpongeBob proposes teaming up with Plankton to find the formula, and the two decide to travel back in time to the moment before the formula disappeared. SpongeBob and Plankton assemble the machine and travel far into the future, where they meet Bubbles, a magical bottlenose dolphin who acts as an overseer of the galaxy, and inadvertently get him fired. After escaping a furious Bubbles, SpongeBob and Plankton retrieve the formula from the past, but upon returning to their time, they discover that it is the fake one previously left by Plankton. A deranged Sandy suggests a sacrifice to appease the \\\"sandwich gods\\\" for Krabby Patties and SpongeBob volunteers. As the town attempts to do so, the latter alerts the crowd that he smells Krabby Patties, which Mr. Krabs also smells. The townsfolk follow the scent, which leads to the surface. Bubbles returns, telling SpongeBob that he hated his job and is grateful that he was fired. He repays SpongeBob by granting him and his friends the ability to breathe on land in order to follow the smell. The team lands on a beach and discovers that the smell leads to Burger Beard's ship, which he has converted into a food truck. Burger Beard is revealed to have stolen the formula using the magical book. He then uses the book to banish the group to an island full of pelicans. SpongeBob uses the page Sandy had to transform himself and the others into superheroes. They return and find Burger Beard, who drives away with the formula, and give chase. During the ensuing battle, the team destroys the book, but Burger Beard manages to overpower them. Plankton appears as a muscle-bound hero and attacks Burger Beard. With SpongeBob's help, the two reclaim the formula and send Burger Beard flying back to Bikini Atoll. The gang uses the final page's magic to return to Bikini Bottom. With the Krabby Patties back, the city is returned to normal and Plankton resumes his role as business rival.

In a sequence deleted from the theatrical release, Slash makes a cameo appearance as a busker. His scene is briefly featured in a trailer, and is included among the special features for the Blu-ray release of the film.[7][8] Production[edit] Development[edit] Following the release of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie in 2004, producer Julia Pistor stated that a sequel film was unlikely despite its successful box office performance.[9] In a 2009 interview with Digital Spy, former SpongeBob SquarePants writer and executive producer Paul Tibbitt was asked about the possibility of a sequel;[10] he said, \\\"I think that they are talking about doing that, but I haven't signed up for anything. We just feel like we've told so many stories, and SpongeBob exists so well in this short 11-minute form.\\\"[10] He also stated that making another film was \\\"a huge challenge\\\".[10] However, Tibbitt said a sequel is not impossible, saying \\\"I wouldn't say no, but I don't know if there will be another one\\\".[10] In 2010, Nickelodeon was reportedly approaching the crews of the show to make another film adaptation.[11] The network had long wanted to partner with sister company Paramount Pictures to release another SpongeBob SquarePants film to help reinvigorate the series' declining ratings.[12] Internal disagreement delayed collaborations.[11][12] On March 4, 2011, the Los Angeles Times reported Paramount had \\\"another SpongeBob picture\\\" in development.[13] In July the same year, Paramount formed its new animation unit, Paramount Animation, in the wake of the commercial and critical success of the 2011 animated film Rango and the departure of DreamWorks Animation upon completion of its distribution contract in 2012.[14] Philippe Dauman, a former president and CEO of Paramount and Nickelodeon's parent company Viacom, officially announced on February 28, 2012, that a sequel film was in development and was due for an unspecified 2014 release, saying; \\\"We will be releasing a SpongeBob movie at the end of 2014\\\".[15][16][17] Dauman said the new film \\\"will serve to start off or be one of our films that starts off our new animation effort\\\".[15] Nickelodeon expected the film to do much better in foreign box offices than the 2004 feature considering the channel's increasingly global reach.[12][18] Dauman said, \\\"This will continue to propel SpongeBob internationally\\\".[12] Production was announced on June 10, 2012, under the title The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie 2,[19] which some trade publications began referring to as SpongeBob SquarePants 2.[20] The film's executive producer is series creator Stephen Hillenburg, who left his role as the series' showrunner in 2004 following the release of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie. He was no longer involved in the writing process or directly running the show on a day-to-day basis, but reviewed episodes and delivered suggestions.[21][22] In a 2012 interview with Thomas F. Wilson, however, Hillenburg said he was helping to write the film.[23] Casting[edit] The main cast of the television series reprised their roles for The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water.[20] In August 2013, casting directors from Marty Siu Casting began casting calls for the background extras for the live-action scenes.[24][25] On September 21, 2013, it was reported that Spanish actor Antonio Banderas had been cast for a live-action role as Burger Beard the pirate.[26][27] Animation[edit] The 2D hand-drawn animated sequences for The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water were done in South Korea by Rough Draft Studios Korea.[citation needed] As did its predecessor, the film combines traditional animation with live action,[28][29] and also used computer-generated imagery (CGI), which was handled by Iloura VFX in Melbourne, Australia, to render the characters in 3D.[30][31] In a 2012 preview of upcoming Paramount films, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water was exhibited as a \\\"3D feature film\\\" with \\\"CGI-like animation\\\".[32] Following the release of SpongeBob SquarePants 4-D: The Great Jelly Rescue (2013), a 3D short film that was released at the Nickelodeon Suites Resort Orlando, executives talked about continuing the use of 3D in the film.[33] The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water contains a stop-motion sequence that was animated by Screen Novelties;[34][35] the company had previously produced a clay animation scene for the first SpongeBob SquarePants film, the mixed-media opening of the television episode \\\"Truth or Square\\\", and the entirety of the stop-motion special It's a SpongeBob Christmas!.[36] In March 2014, Paramount screened live-action footage from the film during the National Association of Theatre Owners' event CinemaCon. News websites report that the film would be CGI-animated;[37] an Internet Movie Database staff member commented; \\\"When Paramount announced there would be a new SpongeBob SquarePants movie, the assumption was that it would be animated (like all other incarnations of SpongeBob). The very brief footage from tonight's presentation suggested otherwise \\u2013 it looked as though this was a CGI/live-action hybrid akin to Alvin and the Chipmunks, Yogi Bear, The Smurfs, etc.\\\"[38] In an article published by ComingSoon.net, author Edward Douglas said the film's CGI footage looks \\\"weird\\\".[39] Philippe Dauman said the CGI elements are intended to \\\"refresh and give another boost\\\" to the characters.[40] Filming[edit] The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water includes live-action scenes that were directed by Mike Mitchell.[41] Filming began on September 30, 2013, and finished on November 5 of the same year. Filming was done at multiple locations in Savannah and Tybee Island; both of which are in Georgia.[42][43][44] On July 11, 2013, the Savannah Film Office announced the filming of live-action scenes in Savannah for 40 days.[29] Will Hammargren, Savannah Film Office's location specialist, said the film was expected to contribute $8 million to the city's economy, including hotel bookings of at least 5,600 room nights.[45][46] The film's live-action scenes were shot on various locations in Georgia, including downtown Savannah (top) and Tybee Island's Pier (bottom). On September 30, 2013, the start of production filming was interrupted by the dismissal of film services director Jay Self.[47][48] According to a memorandum from Joe Shearouse, bureau chief of the leisure services department of Savannah, Self was fired for his \\\"failure to properly plan and manage the arrangement for the movie\\\".[47][49] The memo accused Self of shortcomings surrounding the filming and also cited complaints from residents of Savannah.[47][49][50][51] Another reported reason for Self's dismissal was a disagreement between Paramount and the Savannah Film Office about the process of negotiating compensation for local businesses with Paramount to cover losses of trade during filming.[52] To prepare the filming location in the downtown Savannah, the film crew painted storefronts along Broughton Street to resemble a coastal community called \\\"Salty Shoals\\\".[45][53][54][55] Savannah College of Art and Design's Jen Library and Trustees Theater was converted into a maritime museum.[53] In August 2013, Paramount approached SCAD to use the Jen Library for a scene.[56] The studio's art department transformed the building;[56] it remained open to students during filming.[56][57] Self said, \\\"The changes are temporary with all buildings scheduled to be restored to their original colors after filming is complete\\\".[54][58] Filming in downtown Savannah began on October 9; parts of Broughton Street were closed until October 18.[53][59][60] Antonio Banderas was filmed on a pirate ship with wheels for a car-chase scene.[53][61][62] At one point, a film-crew member caused an accident that damaged a downtown building and a woman was taken to a hospital.[63][64] Filming in the city ended on October 18, when a raffle was also held;[65] the prizes included a SpongeBob SquarePants-themed party, bicycles, a vacation, dinner at a local bistro, gift certificates, and a 60-inch (1.5 m) television.[65] The production received mixed responses from businesses located in filming areas.[52] Businesses were concerned about filming in October because that month is \\\"a big month for merchants along Broughton [Street]\\\".[52] Some merchants suggested filming in February, July, or August instead.[52] Live-action filming resumed on O\"]"
